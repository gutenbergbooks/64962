<p><span class="smcap">Hampstead Heath!</span> What a world of delight
seemed concentrated in that name in the days
of childhood, when donkey-riding was not yet
too undignified an amusement, and a gallop ‘cross
country’ through the bracken and furze struck
terror into the heart of nurse or parent, and
covered the rider with glory! Such feats of
horsemanship now belong to the irrevocable past;
but yet no part of the great ‘province of houses’
known as London brings such pleasant memories
as the quaint old village on its northern outskirts
and the wild breezy heath that bounds it. Even
now, Hampstead is rather in London, than of
it, and keeps up customs that have died out elsewhere.
There, on the fifth of November, a gallant
procession takes its way through its steep winding
streets, and the centuries mingle with as little
regard to accuracy as they might do in a schoolboy’s
dream the night before an examination in
history. Gallant Crusaders in chain-mail, with
the red cross embroidered on their flowing white
mantles, jostle very nineteenth-century Guardsmen,
who in their turn seem to feel no surprise
at seeing Charles I. in velvet doublet and lace
collar talking amicably to a motley, spangled
harlequin. But were the inhabitants in this
their yearly carnival to picture the history of
their village and of the notable personages who
have lived in it, they might make a pageant as
long and varied as any that imagination can
invent.</p>

<p>The manor of Hampstead was given by Edward
the Confessor to the monks of Westminster; and
subsequent monarchs conferred on them the
neighbouring manors of Belsize and Hendon.
It was at Hendon Manor-house that Cardinal
Wolsey made his first halt when journeying from
Richmond to York after his disgrace. At that
time, however, Hampstead itself had no great
claim to notice, its inhabitants being, we are told,
chiefly washerwomen, whose services were in great
demand among the inhabitants of London. That
this peaceful if humble occupation could be
carried on, proves at least that the wolves which,
according to Dame Juliana Berners’s <i>Boke of St
Albans</i>, abounded among the northern heights
of London in the fifteenth century, had been
exterminated by the end of the sixteenth. The
wild-boar lingered longer; and so late as 1772,
we hear of the hunting of a deer in Belsize Park.
This, however, can scarcely be regarded as genuine
sport, as it is advertised to take place among other
amusements intended to allure visitors to Belsize
House, which had been opened as a pleasure-house
by an energetic individual of the name of
Howell. He describes in his advertisement all
the attractions of the place, and promises for the
protection of visitors that ‘twelve stout fellows
completely armed will patrol between Belsize
and London.’</p>

<p>Early in the eighteenth century chalybeate
wells were discovered at Hampstead, and as they
were recommended by several physicians, the
hitherto quiet village became a fashionable and
dissipated watering-place. Idle London flocked
there: youths who were delighted to show their
finery in a new place; girls who were young
enough to delight in the prospect of dancing all
night; gamblers of both sexes; wits and fops.
They danced, lost their money at cards and
dice, talked scandal of each other, and drank of the
chalybeate well, which Sam Weller has characterised
for all generations as ‘water with a taste
of warm flat-irons,’ till Hampstead lost its novelty,
and the company went elsewhere to go through
the same programme.</p>

<p>Among the crowd of nonentities that frequent
the Hampstead Wells there is one notable figure,
that of Richard Steele. In 1712, Steele retired
from London to a small house on Haverstock
Hill, on the road to Hampstead. Here, doubtless,
his friend and fellow-labourer Addison visited
him; and the two would find in the humours and
follies of the company at the Wells material for the
next number of the <i>Tatler</i>, the publication of which
had now been going on for three years. Let us
picture the two friends passing together through
the gay company—Steele, radiant, we may be sure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">{66}</span>
in gay apparel, seizing at once on the humorous
characteristics of the scene; while Addison would
tone down his companion’s exuberant fancy, and
draw his own thoughtful moralisings from the
follies he witnessed. On summer evenings they
would walk on the Heath, and admire the view
across the swelling green slopes to the town of
Harrow, where one day was to be educated my
Lord Byron, a young gentleman who would win
greater fame as a poet than even Addison’s
acquaintance—a protégé to begin with, an enemy
at last—the lame Catholic gentleman, Mr Alexander
Pope.</p>

<p>The friendship between Steele and Addison
must ever remain a puzzle. They had talent
in common, Steele having the more original
genius, Addison the more cultivated taste; but
otherwise there seems no point of contact between
the natures of graceless, impulsive, erring, loving
Dick, and his cold, conscientious, methodical
comrade. To our century, as to his own, Steele
is ‘Dicky;’ the king made him Sir Richard,
and on the strength of his title he took a fine
house in Soho Square, and swaggered more than
ever, and increased his expenses and his debts,
but to all the world he was Dicky Steele still;
whereas, had the honour of a baronetcy befallen
Mr Secretary Addison, can we doubt that to all
posterity he would have been known as ‘Sir
Joseph?’ Yet these two men, unlike each other
as they were, united to perform in an unobtrusive
fashion a great work; they purified English
literature, and did much to reform English
manners. In a society which had learned to
regard truth, honesty, and virtue as absurd,
they showed, not the wickedness of vice—no one
would have listened to that—but its folly. When
the fops and gamblers found that they, as well
as the honest men they sneered at, could be made
the subject of satire, they began to doubt if their
cherished amusements were such essential characteristics
of ‘men of spirit’ as they had fancied. The
gulf that lies between the comedies of Wycherley
and those of Sheridan was first opened by the
gentle raillery of the <i>Tatler</i> and the <i>Spectator</i>.
The later dramatist had no keener moral sense
than the earlier, but he lived in an atmosphere
which, though by no means pure, was healthier
than that breathed by his predecessor; and in
which it was necessary that virtue, however weak,
should in the end defeat the vice that tried to
trade upon its feebleness.</p>

<p>Of the clear-cut grace of style that distinguished
the writing of the <i>Spectator</i> there is no need to
speak; it still remains the model of English prose,
while the tiny, whitish-brown sheet, the perusal
of which used to add to the flavour of Belinda’s
morning chocolate, was the progenitor of the
immense mass of periodical literature that surrounds
us to-day. But if the two friends had
done nothing more than give us—Steele the first
sketch, Addison the finished portrait, of old-fashioned,
kind, eccentric Sir Roger de Coverley,
they would have deserved a high and loving
place in our memory.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, the figure of another literary
man was to be seen at Hampstead. Not
so gorgeous as Dick, not so precise as Addison, is
slovenly, tea-drinking, long-worded Samuel Johnson;
but he is their legitimate successor, nevertheless.
He, too, is a man of letters, living by
the produce of his pen, and appealing for support
to the public, and not to the kindness or
charity of private patrons. Indeed, he scorns
such condescending patronage, as a certain stinging
letter to Lord Chesterfield remains to testify.
In 1748, Mrs Johnson, for the sake of the country
air, took lodgings at Hampstead; and there her
husband wrote his satire, <i>The Vanity of Human
Wishes</i>. Johnson did not spend all his time at
Hampstead, for he was obliged to return and
drudge in smoky London in order to provide for
her comfort. Boswell tells us that ‘she indulged
in country air and good living at an unsuitable
expense; and she by no means treated her husband
with that complacency which is the most engaging
quality in a wife.’ Yet Johnson loved faithfully
and mourned sincerely the querulous, exacting
woman, a quarter of a century older than himself,
and cherished an undoubting belief in her beauty;
while all save him perceived that if she had ever
possessed any—which they doubted—it had long
disappeared.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century,
Hampstead became the dwelling-place of two
famous lawyers, both of them Scotch—Lords
Erskine and Mansfield. Thomas Erskine, youngest
son of the tenth Earl of Buchan, and ‘a penniless
lad with a lang pedigree,’ began life as a midshipman;
but disliking the service, he, after his father’s
death, invested the whole of his little patrimony
in the purchase of an ensigncy in the 1st Foot.
When, some years later, he felt his true vocation
to be the bar, he was burdened with the responsibility
of a wife and children; and it was only by
the exercise of economy nearly approaching privation
that he succeeded in maintaining himself
during the three years’ study that must elapse
before he was called to the bar. Even when he
received his qualification, it seemed that he was
to fail through lack of opportunity to display his
talents; but opportunity came at last, and his
brilliant career led to the Lord Chancellorship of
England, a peerage, and the Order of the Thistle.
All the power of his oratory and of his ever-increasing
influence was devoted to the promotion
of freedom, civil and religious. He stood up
boldly for the independence of juries against the
bullying of judges; he advocated concessions to
the Catholics; and carrying his love of mercy and
justice beyond the human race, he brought into
parliament a bill for the prevention of cruelty to
animals. The measure failed; for popular feeling
on the subject was then such as is expressed in
the famous couplet—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Things is come to a pretty pass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When a man mayn’t wollop his own jackass.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But before Erskine died, it had become law.</p>

<p>William Murray, Earl of Mansfield, was the
eleventh of the fourteen children of Viscount
Stormont, of the castle of Scone, in Perthshire.
So poor was his lordship, that, as we are told by
Mansfield’s biographer, the only fare he could
provide for those fourteen mouths—which though
high-born, were every whit as hungry as if they
had been peasants’—was oatmeal porridge. The
family was Jacobite in politics, so its fortunes
were little likely to improve; but by the
influence of Bishop Atterbury, who was at
heart a Jacobite too, little Willie was admitted
to Westminster School. He made good use of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">{67}</span>
his time there; and by listening to the debates
in Westminster Hall he became enamoured of
the law, and resolved to devote himself to it.
Difficulties enough lay before him; but by the
aid of an indomitable perseverance, a gentle
manner, and a voice so musical that none could
listen to it unmoved, he conquered them all.
Throughout his legal career he was noted for
strict integrity and justice. He advocated free
trade and religious toleration, and used every
effort in his power to decrease the waste of time
and money in the business of law-courts; but
his greatest title to honour is that he was the first
to decide that no slave could remain a slave on
English soil.</p>

<p>Early in this century, the year after Waterloo
was fought, Hampstead was familiar with the
forms of three men to whom life gave only scorn,
insult, and disappointment, yet whose memory
lingers about it and makes it hallowed ground.
In 1816, Leigh Hunt lived at Hampstead in a
part called the Vale of Health; and there Keats,
who lodged in the village, and Shelley were his
frequent visitors. Each of the three was more
or less a martyr. For the crime of describing
the Prince Regent—whose memory as George IV.
is not highly honoured—as an ‘Adonis of fifty,’
Hunt was thrown into prison; while the political
reviews and journals abused his graceful poems
and scholarly essays as if they had been firebrands,
to extinguish which every exertion must be made.
They succeeded in torturing him, in reducing
him to poverty and dependence, but they did
not succeed in changing Leigh Hunt’s convictions.
He would not bow down to the Adonis of
fifty.</p>

<p>Shelley was rather a visitor than a resident at
Hampstead Heath; but Keats composed not a
few of his poems here. The sorrows of his
sorrowful life had not yet reached their climax
in 1816. Already he was struggling with poverty,
disease, and hopeless, passionate love; but he had
not yet published those poems which were to
rouse such wrath in the bosoms of a few critics,
and such delight in thousands of readers. But
at Hampstead most of them were written. Here
he breathed life into the long dead myth of
Endymion, surrounding it with such a wealth of
description as seems scarcely possible to a youth
of such limited experience. Can commonplace
Hampstead Heath, the chosen resort of Bank-holiday
excursionists, be the prototype of that
Grecian valley where the goddess of night stooped
to kiss Endymion! Here were written the sad
story of <i>The Pot of Basil</i> and the legend of <i>The
Eve of St Agnes</i>; here, in 1819, was composed that
most exquisite <i>Ode to a Nightingale</i>, which, even
were it his only production, might place Keats
among our greater poets.</p>

<p>The memory loves to trace the footsteps of
departed greatness; but even did no such recollections
as these endear Hampstead Heath, it
would still be precious as a spot where half-asphyxiated
Londoners may inhale a fresh untainted
breeze, and children may romp to their
hearts’ content. ‘I like Hampstead Heath much
better than Switzerland,’ says a small boy in
one of Du Maurier’s sketches in <i>Punch</i>. ‘But
you haven’t seen Switzerland,’ objects his sister,
a practical young lady a year or two older.
‘O yes; I have seen it on the map,’ is his reply.
And if he had really visited Switzerland, the little
fellow would perhaps still have preferred the
broken, sandy soil, the grass and ferns, of Hampstead
Heath.</p>

<p>Du Maurier is the Heath’s own artist. He
lives on its borders, and most of the backgrounds
of his out-of-door sketches are borrowed from its
scenery. He may daily be seen there—till lately
accompanied by his dog Chang, the great St
Bernard whose portrait has so often appeared in
the pages of <i>Punch</i>. But, alas! Chang is no
more; he has fallen a victim to consumption and
heart-disease, and Hampstead weeps for him.
Seldom has any dog been so widely lamented.
‘He is mourned by a large circle of friends,’
said the <i>World</i>, ‘and the family of which he was
so long a member is inconsolable for his loss.’</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.—AN UNLOVED LIFE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a little time before the father spoke
again. But without being able to see his face,
even without being able to hear him breathe,
Philip felt that he was struggling with something
in himself. Perhaps it was only a struggle to
regain that composure of manner which he had
temporarily lost. In this he succeeded. But
was that all Mr Hadleigh was struggling with
in those few moments of silence? At anyrate,
when he spoke, his voice was steadier than
before; more like its ordinary tone, but without
its hardness.</p>

<p>‘Before I proceed, may I ask what was the
purport of the two letters you received?’</p>

<p>‘The one was simply urging me on no account
to fail to start in the <i>Hertford Castle</i> as arranged,
and assuring me of such welcome as I might
desire.’</p>

<p>‘That was not much to write about. And the
other?’</p>

<p>‘The other inclosed a note which I am to
deliver personally to a firm of solicitors in the
City, and requesting that I should bring with
me the packet they would intrust to my care.’</p>

<p>‘Is that all?’</p>

<p>‘That is all, sir.’</p>

<p>‘One question more. Are you <i>very</i> anxious
to make this journey, which may end in nothing?
Is there no one here who could persuade you
to give it up altogether?’</p>

<p>Philip was a good deal perplexed as to how
he should answer this question. There was Some
one who could have persuaded him to stay at
home; but the sweet voice of that Some one was
again whispering in his ear, ‘It was your mother’s
wish that you should go;’ and besides, there was
the natural desire of youth to see strange countries
and peoples.</p>

<p>‘I thought, sir, that this question of my going
out to Uncle Shield had been all settled long
ago,’ he replied awkwardly, for he knew that
any reference to the command laid upon him
by his mother always disturbed his father.</p>

<p>‘That is not an answer to my questions.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I consider it my duty to go.’</p>

<p>‘And you wish to go?’</p>

<p>‘I do—now. Even setting aside the prospects
he holds out to me, I feel that I must go.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">{68}</span></p>

<p>The father made a mental note of the fact
that his son gave no reply to the second question;
but he did not press it farther at this moment.
He seemed to draw breath, and then went on
in a low voice: ‘I think, Philip, you have not
found me an exacting parent. Although I have
never failed to point out to you the way in which
it would please me most to see you walk, I have
never insisted upon it. And I will own that
on your part your conduct has been up to a
certain point satisfactory.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, sir.’</p>

<p>‘That certain point is your procrastination
in the choice of your future career. You have
shown that you do not care about business—and
my own conviction is that you are unfitted
for it—and you will not decide upon a profession.
Although you have dabbled in medicine
and law, you have not entered earnestly upon
the study of either. I have been patient with
this wavering state of mind which you have
displayed ever since you left the university.
I do not wish to force you into any occupation
which you may dislike, and would, therefore,
certainly fail in; for then you would console
yourself by blaming me for being the cause
of your failure.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, no—do not think me so ungrateful.’</p>

<p>‘But I did hope,’ continued the father calmly,
without heeding the interruption, ‘that before you
came to think of marriage, you would have settled
with yourself upon some definite course of action
in the future.’</p>

<p>‘Your reproaches are just, sir,’ answered Philip
earnestly and with some agitation, ‘and I deserve
them. But this journey will decide what I
am to be and do.’</p>

<p>‘I did not mean to reproach you,’ said the
father, and again there was that distant note
of sadness which sounded so strangely in his
voice; ‘but it seemed to me right to remind you
of these things before telling you the rest. I
reproach myself more than you.’</p>

<p>‘I do not understand.’</p>

<p>‘Listen. My young life was passed in a home
which had been suddenly stricken down from
wealth and ease to poverty. On every hand I
heard the one explanation given for my father’s
haggard looks, my mother’s wasting illness, for
my poor sister’s white face and constant drudgery
with her needle, and for my own unsatisfied
hunger; and that explanation was—the want
of money.... I resolved that I should conquer
this demon that was destroying us all—I resolved
that I should have money.’</p>

<p>Here he paused, as if the memory of that time
of misery proved too painful for him. Philip’s
sympathetic nature was drawn closer to his father
at that moment than it had ever been before. He
rose impulsively and grasped his arm. In the
darkness the forms of the two men were indistinguishable
to each other; but with that sympathetic
touch each saw the other clearly in a
new light.</p>

<p>‘My poor father,’ murmured Philip, clenching
his teeth to keep down the sob that was in his
throat.</p>

<p>There was silence; and at that moment a pale
gleam of moonlight stole across the room. But it
seemed only to darken the corner in which the
two men stood.</p>

<p>By-and-by Mr Hadleigh gently removed his
son’s hand.</p>

<p>‘Sit down again, Philip, or go over to the
window so that I may see you.’</p>

<p>Philip walked quietly to a place opposite the
window, and putting his hands behind him, rested
them on the ledge of a bookcase, leaning back
so that the light fell full upon his frank, handsome
face, making it look very pale in his anxiety.
He knew that his father was gazing earnestly at
him, and as he could not see him, he was glad
to hear his voice again, which in some measure
took away the uncomfortable feeling produced
by the singular position.</p>

<p>‘You know that I gained my object,’ Mr
Hadleigh proceeded, with a mingling of bitterness
and regret in his voice; ‘but at what a
cost!... All the lightness of heart which makes
the lives of even the poorest children happy at
times—all the warmth of hope and enthusiasm
which brightens the humblest youth, were gone.
It was not hope that led me on: it was determination.
All emotion was dead within me: at
twenty I was an old man; and in the hard
grasping struggle with which I fought against
the demon Poverty, and won the favour of the
greater demon, Wealth—even love itself was
sacrificed.’</p>

<p>He paused again; but this time Philip did not
speak or move. There was something so pitiful
as well as painful in this confession that he was
dumb.</p>

<p>‘They—father, mother, sister—all died before
I had broken down the first barrier between me
and fortune. I shed no tears: each death in
poverty hardened me more and more.... It was—your
mother who enabled me to break down
the first barrier’——</p>

<p>‘Ah, I am glad of that,’ exclaimed the son with
a burst of happy relief.</p>

<p>‘Wait. I did not know what love was: I did
not love her.’ (Philip started, but remained
silent.) ‘She had money: I married her for it.
She did not love me; but she had quarrelled
with the man she did love, and accepted me in
her mad chagrin. We understood each other,
and I was content—she was not. From the day
of her marriage to the day of her death, her life
was one weary lamentation that in her moment
of passion I had crossed her path—a life of self-scourging
and regret for the man she loved. I
saw it, and knew it; but I did not know what
love was, and I could not pity it. I did know
something of hate; and I believed she hated
me.... Had she only cared for me a little, it
might have been different,’ he added in a lower
voice, and as if speaking to himself.</p>

<p>‘You wrong her, father, you wrong her,’ said
Philip in a husky, tremulous voice.</p>

<p>‘It may be; but I did not know then, what
I understand too well now. A pity, a pity—for
it might have been so different! As it was, her
brother turned from her too, and would not
forgive her. He hated me—he hates me: because
the lover she had deserted was his close friend;
and whilst I prospered, his friend failed. In a
few years the man had lost everything he possessed,
and died—some say by his own hand:
killed by me, as your mother seemed to believe,
and as Austin Shield does believe. I had ruined
his life, he said, and I was as much responsible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">{69}</span>
for his death, as if I had given him poison or
shot him. These were the last words Shield ever
spoke to me.’</p>

<p>‘It must have been in mere passion. He
cannot believe that now, or he would not send
for me.’</p>

<p>‘I do not know. I went on my way, unheeding
his words, and would have forgotten him, but for
your mother’s grief. I had no home-life; but I
did my duty, as it seemed to me. The money
which had been brought to me was repaid with
compound interest: all that money could buy
was at your mother’s command: all that she
could wish for her children was supplied to
them, and you all seemed satisfied. But I was
not with you—you were hushed and lifeless in
my presence, and seemed only happy in my
absence. Sitting in this room, I have heard
your voices raised in gladness, and if I passed in
amongst you, seeking for that strange something
which the Demon Wealth with all his gold could
not supply, it seemed as if the Demon sat upon
my shoulder, frightening you and rendering you
speechless. So I lived alone, although so near
you, and my Familiar became kinder and kinder
to me, until I wearied of him. I sought I did
not know what, and could not find it.’</p>

<p>He stopped, breathing heavily, as if suppressing
his emotion.</p>

<p>‘Oh, if you had only spoken to us as you
are speaking to me now, father!’ cried Philip, so
earnestly that it sounded like a reproach.</p>

<p>‘It would have been better,’ was the sad reply.
‘I tell you these things that you may understand
the proposal I am about to make to you. I now
know what love is, and as too often happens, the
knowledge comes too late. But it will help me
in my effort to make two people happy. Can you
guess who they are?’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid you must inform me.’</p>

<p>‘Yourself and Ma—Miss Heathcote. I propose
that you should stay at home and marry as soon
as may be agreeable to the lady. I shall settle
upon you a sufficient fortune to enable you to
live comfortably; but I shall expect you to enter
some profession. Do you consent?’</p>

<p>Here was a proposal at which Philip’s whole
nature jumped gleefully. But that voice was in
his ears, and he overcame the temptation.</p>

<p>‘It was my mother’s wish that I should go, if
my uncle ever summoned me,’ he said in a respectful
but decisive voice, ‘and I must go.’</p>

<p>‘So be it,’ rejoined the father, and there was
a note of bitterness in his tone; ‘I shall not again
attempt to alter your plans.’</p>

<p>There was a peculiar emphasis on the ‘I.’</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.—‘WILL YOU SPEAK THAT WORD?’</h3>

<p>Madge was singing as she dressed in her pretty
little room, filled with the exhilarating breath
of the early morning, which the wide open
window admitted freely. This was no dainty
lady’s chamber full of costly nick-knacks. Everything
in it was useful, and everything was so
bright and simple, that glancing into it on a
winter’s day, one might have imagined that
summer still lingered here.</p>

<p>As she stood at the chintz-draped toilet-table
she could see the green glades apparently rising
amidst the trees, one glade half in shadow, another
with its dewdrops glistening like diamonds in the
morning sunshine. Beyond that on the high
ground were yellow plains of ripe grain, relieved
by black and gray patches, which she knew to
be fields of beans and tares. Down below there,
at the foot of the meadows, the calmly flowing
river sent silver flashes through every space left
by the willows and elms. Farther on, she saw
the stumpy tower of the old village church
struggling to raise its head through a mass of ivy.
And to all this her window, with its surrounding
network of rose-tree branches, formed a suitable
frame.</p>

<p>It was not a blithe song she was singing, and
yet the hope that was in her voice and in her
eyes took away from it all thought of sadness.
It was that now old-fashioned but once popular
song of the <i>Soldier’s Tear</i>, and she dwelt with
sympathy on the lines, ‘Upon the hill he turned,
to take a last fond look.’ She repeated them
dreamily again and again, and then her face
would brighten into smiles when the happier
picture presented itself of the time when she
should stand on the top of the hill, or at the
more probable although more prosaic railway
station, welcoming Philip home.</p>

<p>Ah, it was much better to think of that.
And then, what was a year, or what were two
years, to reckon in their young lives, when all
the succeeding years would be theirs to pass
together—always together—no matter what Aunt
Hessy might say? Besides, there would be his
letters! He would speak to her in them every
day, and she would speak to him every day. Of
course, the ridiculous postal arrangements would
not permit them to receive the letters on the
day they were written; but when they <i>were</i>
delivered, they would contain a full record of
their daily lives.</p>

<p>Up from the barnyard came the loud voice of
one of the labourers, rising above the obstreperous
squeaking of the pigs he was feeding, as he
drawled out a verse of some rustic ballad—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ow Mary Styles, Ow Mary Styles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It’s ’long ov yow I’m dying,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if yow won’t have me at last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Why, then, there’s no use crying.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A delightful combination of sentiment and
philosophy, thought Madge, smiling.</p>

<p>Then came the other sounds which intimated
that another day’s work of the farm had begun.
The milk-cans rattled as they were whirled out
of the dairy to the waiting carts; merry jests
were passed between the men and maids; harness
clattered and clanked as the horses were put
into the carts or reaping-machine; and there was
much horse-language mingling with the confusion
of dialects as the harvest hands turned out to
the fields. The melancholy ‘moo’ of the cows
rose from the barn as, having been milked, they
were driven out to the meadows; the cocks,
although they had been crowing since daybreak,
crowed with louder defiance than ever, now that
their hens were cackling and clucking around
them; and the ducks emitted their curious self-satisfied
‘quack’ as they waggled off to the
pond.</p>

<p>All these sounds warned Madge that she was
somewhat later than usual in getting downstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">{70}</span></p>

<p>She was a little startled when she discovered
on the hall table a letter bearing the Ringsford
Manor crest; for she knew at once it was not
from Philip, and feared that some mishap might
have befallen him. She knew it was not from
him, because he never used this crest, although
all the other members of the family did. It had
been the outcome of Miss Hadleigh’s vanity, to
which the others took kindly, whilst Philip
laughed at it.</p>

<p>She learned that the note had been delivered
about half an hour ago by young Jerry Mogridge,
who left a special message that the ‘flunkey’ who
gave it to him said it was to be given to her the
moment she came down. She was surprised to
find that it was from Philip’s father, and still
more surprised by its contents.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Miss Heathcote</span>—The unusual hour
at which this will be delivered will at once
apprise you that the motive which prompts it is
an important one. I cannot tell you how important
it is in my eyes; and I hope and believe
that you will not only appreciate the motive, but
cordially sympathise with it.</p>

<p>Only a few hours ago I had to ask your
assistance in a matter which entirely concerned
myself; in the present instance I have to ask
your assistance in a matter on which, I believe,
your own happiness depends. You shall judge
for yourself; and your answer will enable me
to decide a question which has of late occupied
my mind a great deal.</p>

<p>You have not hitherto heard me raise any
objection to the journey Philip is about to make.
To-day I decided that he ought not to go away.
But after a long and painful conversation with
him, I find that no words of mine can move him
from his purpose.</p>

<p>Now, my dear Miss Heathcote, will you help
me to hold him back from this useless enterprise?</p>

<p>I think you will—unless I am mistaken as
to the nature of your feelings in regard to
him.</p>

<p>My first and chief reason for desiring to keep
him at home is my anxiety to see you and him
happy—to see you two united, and him, under
your influence, working earnestly in some profession.</p>

<p>I fear there is much danger that this desire
of mine will never be realised, if he is permitted
to spend a year with one who would delight in
thwarting any wish of mine. You know his
impulsive and impressionable nature. You are
too young for experience to have taught you—and
I earnestly trust it may never teach you—that
absence, change of scene, and adverse counsels
are not the most favourable conditions for keeping
the most honest man steadfast.</p>

<p>Pray, do not misunderstand me. I do not doubt
Philip. He is honest; but with such a nature
as his, I think the trial of his honesty is too
severe; and I object to it all the more because
it is absolutely unnecessary. My proposal to him
is that he should abandon this journey, that
he should enter a profession at once, and that
you should be married at as early a date as
you may be inclined to fix. I need not say
that you will be provided with ample means.</p>

<p>In the course of my life, few of the desires
springing from my affections have been gratified.
I beg of you to gratify this one. Although he
resolutely declines to forego his purpose for my
sake, I feel assured that you have only to speak
one word—‘stay’—and he will forego it for
yours.</p>

<p>Will you speak that word?</p>

<p>Believe me, your humble servant,<br />
<span class="smcap ml4">Lloyd Hadleigh.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>There was something so pathetic and yet so
strange in this appeal of the father that she should
keep his son near him, that Madge was pained as
well as bewildered. Keep Philip at home!—marry
him!—be happy!—help to steady his
impulsive nature and influence him in some good
work! What else was there that she could desire
more? How beautiful the visions were that these
suggestions conjured up. Her face brightened as
if a blaze of sunshine fell upon it ... and then
it suddenly darkened.</p>

<p>She, too, like Philip remembered the dead
mother’s wish, and hesitated. But the question
presented itself: if his mother had been alive now
and had understood all the circumstances, would
she have insisted upon this wish—which seemed
to cause the father so much anxiety—being carried
out?</p>

<p>She read the letter again, and this time her
cheeks flushed a little at the doubt of her implied
in the words, ‘unless I am mistaken as to the
nature of your feelings.’ The unpleasant sensation
was only momentary. How could he—how even
could Philip—realise her feelings? But she also
became conscious of a certain vagueness in the
reasons given for the anxiety expressed by Mr
Hadleigh. Were she to grant the appeal, would
it not be a proof of her want of faith in Philip?
<i>That</i> idea was enough to make her answer ‘no’
at once.</p>

<p>And yet she hesitated. The poor old man
was evidently very much in earnest. (She always
thought of Mr Hadleigh as an old man, older
than Uncle Dick, although he was twenty years
younger than the latter.) To say ‘no’ would
cause him much pain: to say ‘yes’ would afford
him much happiness, and at the same time bring
about the completion of her own.</p>

<p>There was a yelping of dogs, and above it the
stentorian voice of her uncle shouting: ‘Down,
Dash, down—here, Rover, here—be quiet, Tip,
you brute.’</p>

<p>The door opened, dogs rushed in and bounded
round Madge in wild delight. They were followed
by Uncle Dick, his fresh ruddy face beaming with
the happiness of health and content.</p>

<p>‘What are you dreaming about, Madge?
Breakfast ready? We are as hungry as if we
had been starving for a week. Thought I should
have met you in the meadow as usual. What’s
the matter?’</p>

<p>‘I am trying to solve a riddle, uncle.’</p>

<p>‘What!’ he exclaimed with a burst of laughter,
‘at this time in the morning. O ho! I see
Master Philip was here too long yesterday.’</p>

<p>‘Will you try it?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be a fool. Call the Missus and let’s
have breakfast.’</p>

<p>‘To please me, uncle,’ she said, putting her
hand on his arm.</p>

<p>‘Well, what is it?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">{71}</span></p>

<p>‘Suppose somebody asked you to do something
that you wanted to do yourself, what would you
say?’</p>

<p>‘That’s easily answered—yes, of course.’</p>

<p>‘But, suppose there were reasons connected
with other people on account of which you ought
to say “no,” what would you do?’</p>

<p>‘Please myself.—Now, let’s have our victuals,
and confound your riddles, or I’ll send for the
doctor and the parson at once.’</p>

<p>There was not much help to Madge in this
easy settlement of the difficulty. But she had
a maxim which did help her: whenever you
have a doubt as to which of two courses you
should take, choose the one which is least agreeable
to yourself. She decided to follow it in
this instance, as she had done in many others
of less importance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MUSE_OF_PARODY">THE MUSE OF PARODY.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Reader</span>, are you of those who cannot tolerate
their favourite authors or their favourite poems
being parodied? A lady-friend of the writer’s
lately said, in regard to one of the best-known
poems of a distinguished poet: ‘I admired and
liked it once; but I can hardly read it now, since
I saw that dreadful parody of it that appeared in
<i>Punch</i>.’ If you are of this sensitive class, we
fear this article is not for you. But we feel pretty
sure of an audience; for we know that the large
majority of readers can relish a clever parody
without in the least losing their enjoyment in or
respect for the thing parodied. And it is well
that it is so; for parody in some shape and to
some extent is early as the beginnings of literature
itself; and if the fame of poets depended
on their immunity from travesty, every poet that
has ever won his bays, and whose reputation now
rests secure and impregnable, would have been
laughed out of court long since.</p>

<p>In speaking of modern English parody, one’s
thoughts turn first, almost inevitably, to the
brothers Horace and James Smith, who, in
<i>Rejected Addresses</i>, may be regarded as the first
to practise parody in a systematised fashion,
as a vehicle of fun and humour. The <i>Rejected
Addresses</i> won high praise from Jeffrey, who pronounced
the parody on Crabbe ‘an exquisite
and masterly imitation;’ while the poet himself
declared it to be ‘admirably done.’ We shall
give a short extract from it, which we think hits
off Crabbe’s manner in a way that fully justifies
Jeffrey’s criticism:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>In regard to the parody of Sir Walter Scott
in <i>Rejected Addresses</i>, the poet himself said: ‘I
must have done it myself, though I forget on
what occasion.’ Here are a few lines descriptive
of the Drury Lane Theatre on fire:</p>

<p>Thackeray was especially happy and especially
funny in his Irish burlesques. <i>Larry O’Toole</i>,
a parody of the rollicking Irish bacchanalian
songs with which Charles Lever made us so
familiar, admirably hits the medium between
close imitation and high burlesque. There is a
dash in it both of <i>Larry O’Hale</i> and the <i>Widow
Malone</i>. We quote two of the three verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>In those two delightful volumes, <i>Alice in
Wonderland</i> and <i>Through the Looking-glass</i>, ‘Lewis
Carroll’ gives us some capital travesties. Mr
Southey’s poem beginning ‘“You are old, Father
William,” the young man said,’ is so familiar,
that every reader will appreciate the point of
the burlesque, without needing the original before
him:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And yet you incessantly stand on your head—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Do you think at your age it is right?’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘In my youth,’ Father William replied to his son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">‘I thought it might injure the brain;</div>

<p>The old nursery song, ‘“Will you walk into my
parlour?” said the Spider to the Fly,’ the same
writer has likewise burlesqued:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Will you walk a little faster?’ said a whiting to a snail;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘There’s a porpoise close behind me, and he’s treading on my tail.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The late Mr J. R. Planché, whose innumerable
fairy extravaganzas were so full of fun and
humour, was also an expert in parody. We give
the first verse of a burlesque by him of the once
popular song, <i>When other Lips</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When other lips and other eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Their tales of love shall tell—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which means the usual sort of lies</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You’ve heard from every swell;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When, bored with every sort of bosh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You’d give the world to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A friend whose love you know will wash,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh, then remember me!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The funniest burlesque of Wordsworth’s <i>We
are Seven</i>, with which we are acquainted, is by
Mr H. S. Leigh:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘I thought it would have sent me mad</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Last night about eleven.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said I: ‘What is it makes you bad?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How many apples have you had?’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She answered: ‘Only seven.’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘And are you sure you took no more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My little maid?’ quoth I.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Oh, please, sir, mother gave me four,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But they were in a pie.’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘If that’s the case,’ I stammered out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">‘Of course you’ve had eleven.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The maiden answered with a pout:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">‘I ain’t had more nor seven.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here are four lines from a travesty of Tennyson’s
<i>May Queen</i>—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘You may lay me in my bed, mother—my head is throbbing sore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And mother, prithee, let the sheets be duly aired before;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if you’d do a kindness to your poor desponding child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Draw me a pot of beer, mother—and, mother, draw it mild.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is not necessary to name the original of the
following. We quote two of the three verses
which compose the whole:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He wore a brace of pistols, the night when first we met;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His deep-lined brow was frowning beneath his wig of jet;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His footsteps had the moodiness, his voice the hollow tone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of a bandit chief, who feels remorse, and tears his hair alone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I saw him but at half-price, but methinks I see him now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the tableau of the last act, with the blood upon his brow.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A <i>private</i> bandit’s belt and boots, when next we met, he wore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His salary, he told me, was lower than before;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And standing at the O. P. wing, he strove, and not in vain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To borrow half a sovereign, which he never paid again.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I saw it but a moment—and I wish I saw it now—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As he buttoned up his pocket with a condescending bow.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tennyson’s well-known lyric, <i>Home they brought
her warrior dead</i>, has been thus amusingly parodied
by Mr Sawyer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Home they brought her sailor son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Grown a man across the sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tall and broad, and black of beard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And hoarse of voice as man may be.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hand to shake, and mouth to kiss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Both he offered ere he spoke;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But she said: ‘What man is this</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Comes to play a sorry joke?’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then they praised him, called him ‘smart,’</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">‘Tightest lad that ever stept;’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But her son she did not know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And she neither smiled nor wept.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Rose, a nurse of ninety years,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Set a pigeon-pie in sight;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She saw him eat: ‘’Tis he, ’tis he!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She knew him—by his appetite.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following clever parody of Wordsworth’s
<i>Lucy</i> is but little known. It was written by
Hartley Coleridge, and reappeared some years ago
in <i>Notes and Queries</i>. We shall quote the first
verse of the original:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She dwelt among the untrodden ways,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Beside the banks of Dove;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A maid whom there were none to praise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And very few to love.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We give two of the three verses composing the
parody:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He lived among the untrodden ways,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To Rydal Mount that lead;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A bard whom there were none to praise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And very few to read.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Unread his works—his <i>Milk-white Doe</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With dust is dark and dim;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It’s still in Longman’s shop; and oh!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The difference to him!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From a parody of Tennyson’s <i>Mariana</i>, which
appeared in an Australian paper, we take the
concluding verse. The burden of the original
ballad, it will be remembered, runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">She only said: ‘My life is dreary;</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">He cometh not,’ she said;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">She said: ‘I am aweary, aweary—</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">I would that I were dead!’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They lifted him with kindly care;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They took him by the heels and head;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Across the floor, and up the stair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They bore him safely to his bed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They wrapped the blankets warm and tight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And round about his nose and chin</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They drew the sheets, and tucked them in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And whispered: ‘Poor old boy—Good-night!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He murmured: ‘Boys, oh, deary, deary,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That punch <i>was</i> strong,’ he said;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He said: ‘I am aweary, aweary—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thank heaven, I’ve got to bed!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An American magazine published some years
ago a series of burlesques of the old nursery
rhymes, of which we give specimens:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Little Jack Horner,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Latin no scorner,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the second declension did spy</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">{73}</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">How of nouns there are some</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, ending in <i>um</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Do <i>not</i> make their plural in <i>i</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Jack and Jill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have studied Mill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And all that sage has taught too;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now both promote</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jill’s claim to vote,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As every good girl ought to.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The case for the evolutionists is thus tersely
put by an American poet, parodying <i>Sing a song
of Sixpence</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sing a song of phosphates,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fibrine in a line,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Four-and-twenty follicles</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the van of time.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the phosphorescence</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Evoluted brain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Superstition ended,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Man began to reign.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pope’s familiar couplet—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here shall the spring its earliest sweets bestow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here the first roses of the year shall blow—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>has been thus travestied by Miss Catherine Fanshawe,
who accomplishes the step from the sublime
to the ridiculous by the change of two words
only:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here shall the spring its earliest coughs bestow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here the first noses of the year shall blow.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among living parodists, few, if any, excel Mr
C. S. Calverley, who seems to possess every qualification
for success in this sort of work. The
reader will at once recognise how happily he has
caught Tennyson’s method and manner in the
following parody of <i>The Brook</i>, especially in the
blank-verse portion. We quote two verses and
the conclusion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">‘I loiter down by thorp and town;</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">For any job I’m willing;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Take here and there a dusty brown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">And here and there a shilling.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">‘I steal from th’ parson’s strawberry plats,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">I hide by the Squire’s covers;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">I teach the sweet young housemaids what’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">The art of trapping lovers.’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus on he prattled like a babbling brook.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I: ‘The sun hath slipt behind the hill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And my Aunt Vivian dines at half-past six.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So in all love we parted; I to the Hall;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They to the village. It was noised next noon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That chickens had been missed at Syllabub Farm.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We had noted down several other examples of
parody by different authors, which might have
served further to illustrate our subject. Our
selections have necessarily lost something of force
and pertinence, from the fragmentary condition
in which we have been obliged to present them;
but the reader, if he be sufficiently interested
in the matter, may easily go to the original
sources.</p>

<p>It needs not to be pointed out that there are
limits to parody, as to all other forms of light and
sportive literature, whose main object is, after all,
to divert and amuse. Good taste should guide
the course of parody, in fact should never be
absent from it. Let the parodist hit as hard
as he pleases, but let him deal no foul blow,
nor aim his strokes at aught that tradition and
the world’s verdict have made sacred and to be
revered. Parody may be as clever, laughable,
and amusing as you can make it; but it should
always be good-natured, fair, and gentlemanly.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">A STORY IN EIGHT CHAPTERS.</p>

<p class="ph3">BY T. W. SPEIGHT.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> his rebuff by Lady Dimsdale, the Baronet
made up his mind to set off home as soon as
possible. He was stung as he had rarely been
stung in his life before, and was in no humour
for the company of any one. But before he could
get away, an almost incredible rumour reached
his ears that Mr Boyd’s long-lost wife had
unexpectedly appeared at Rosemount. This was
enough to induce Sir Frederick to change his
plans, especially when backed up by the Captain’s
pressing invitation to stay for dinner, for who
could tell what unexpected turn events might
now take? So he sent his groom in the dogcart
to fetch his dress clothes, and made up his
mind to remain where he was till the following
morning.</p>

<p>Sir Frederick had easily discovered, by questioning
one of the servants, in which particular
room Mr Boyd and his wife had located themselves.
It was the room next the library. So into
the library went Sir Frederick, on the pretext
of having some letters to write, and there he sat
with the door a little way open—waiting. A
certain strange idea was fermenting in his brain,
which he could not get rid of till he had satisfied
himself whether it had any foundation in fact
or otherwise. The moment he saw Boyd pass
the library door, he knew that the opportunity
for which he had been waiting had come.</p>

<p>Sir Frederick advanced a step or two, and
looked round, as if in search of some one. ‘Pardon
my intrusion,’ he said with a bow; ‘but—Mr
Boyd—is he not here?’</p>

<p>‘Mr Boyd has left the room for a few minutes.
He will be back presently.’</p>

<p>The Baronet gave a well-simulated start at the
first sound of Mrs Boyd’s voice. Then he seemed
to regard her attentively for a moment or two,
with his head a little on one side. ‘Pardon me,’
he said with a half-smile of inquiry, ‘but have
I not the honour of addressing Mrs Boyd?’</p>

<p>At this question she seemed to freeze suddenly.
Her eyes traversed him from head to foot before
she answered him; then in cold clear tones she
said: ‘I am the wife of Oscar Boyd.’</p>

<p>‘I thought I could not be mistaken,’ replied
the Baronet, with his most insinuating smile.—‘I
am Sir Frederick Pinkerton. But it is so long
since I had the pleasure of seeing you last, that
in all probability you have quite forgotten me.’</p>

<p>There was something about him that had evidently
aroused her suspicions. She was at a
loss to know what ground to take with him.
‘Yes—I cannot quite call you to mind,’ she said
hesitatingly, after a little pause. ‘And yet? No.
Tell me where I have seen you before.’</p>

<p>‘At New Orleans.’</p>

<p>‘Ha! I have not been at New Orleans for
many years.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">{74}</span></p>

<p>‘I met you on two or three occasions in society,
a few months after your marriage.’</p>

<p>‘Yes—I think I remember you now. But it
is a long time ago, monsieur, and I was introduced
to so many people about that time.’</p>

<p>‘I entertain a very distinct recollection of you,
madam.’</p>

<p>‘I am indeed flattered, monsieur.’ She smiled
a little set smile, which came and went as if it
were produced by clockwork. She was evidently
far from being at her ease.</p>

<p>‘Your unexpected appearance must have been
a great surprise to Mr Boyd—a surprise and a
pleasure in one. The return of a wife whom he
believed to have been lost to him for ever several
years ago! What a unique experience!’</p>

<p>‘An experience, monsieur, which very few
husbands, I am afraid, would care to have brought
home to themselves. You have an English proverb,
“Out of sight, out of mind.” That is a very
true proverb.’</p>

<p>‘Fie, fie! Mrs Boyd. You must not be so
severe on us poor men. We are not all alike.
Take your own case as an instance. You come
back, from the tomb as it were, after I know not
how many years, and find your husband still
faithful to your memory.—Ah no; you must not
malign us all.’</p>

<p>Was he mocking her, or what, this smiling,
smooth-faced man? She was becoming more
vaguely uneasy every minute, she scarcely knew
why.</p>

<p>‘The sight of you this morning, Mrs Boyd,’
resumed the Baronet, ‘brings to my memory a
certain little incident which I had all but forgotten.
In those days, I was something of a traveller.
About a year subsequently to my introduction to
you, madam, I found myself in Mexico.’</p>

<p>Mrs Boyd could not repress a start, but she
did not speak.</p>

<p>‘While there, singular to say, I made the acquaintance
of a certain relative of yours, who inquired
most particularly concerning your welfare.’</p>

<p>Mrs Boyd’s face might have been seen to pale
even under its artificial colouring. She steadied
her voice by an effort. ‘Of a relation of mine,
monsieur! May I ask his name?’</p>

<p>‘Don Diego Riaz.’ He pronounced the name
slowly, looking fixedly at her the while.</p>

<p>‘Ha!’ She fell back a step, as if some one had
aimed a blow at her, and then one hand went up
quickly to her heart. Both hatred and fear shone
out of the eyes with which she stared at him.</p>

<p>‘By heavens! I have hit the mark,’ said the
Baronet to himself.</p>

<p>‘Who can this man be? How much does he
know?’ was her unspoken thought.</p>

<p>‘I am afraid you are ill, Mrs Boyd,’ remarked
the Baronet.</p>

<p>‘A spasm; a mere nothing,’ she answered.—‘To
return to what you were saying. I have neither
seen nor heard anything of Don Diego Riaz
for many years, and I hope neither to see nor hear
anything of him in time to come. There was
no love lost between him and me.’</p>

<p>‘His was a singular character, and strange tales
were told of him. For instance, it was whispered
that on one occasion when a certain member of
his family left home without his knowledge or
consent, he’——</p>

<p>‘Spare me the recital, I pray of you. The
mere mention of that man’s name is hateful to
me! utterly hateful!’ Her voice was charged
with passion, her black eyes seemed to strike
fire. She walked across to the window and then
came back again.</p>

<p>Sir Frederick felt that he had pursued the
topic as far as it was safe to do so. ‘’Tis she;
I can no longer doubt,’ he murmured to himself.
‘I have not forgotten what I was told in
Mexico.’</p>

<p>‘How much or how little does this man know?’
Estelle kept asking herself. She was seriously
uneasy.</p>

<p>‘Do you purpose making a long stay in England,
Mrs Boyd?’ asked the Baronet in his most matter-of-fact
tone.</p>

<p>‘I think not, Sir Frederick. My husband talks
about sailing for South America in a few days.
He has lost nearly the whole of his fortune. <i>N’est
ce pas?</i>’</p>

<p>‘I believe so. I was prodigiously sorry to hear
of it.—Do you accompany your husband abroad,
Mrs Boyd?’</p>

<p>‘Monsieur! Is it not a wife’s duty to
accompany her husband anywhere and everywhere?
And consider for how many years Oscar
and I have been separated! He would not leave
me behind him for the world.’</p>

<p>‘Yours must be a romantic story, Mrs Boyd.
I hope we shall have the pleasure of hearing
from your lips some particulars of your marvellous
escape.’</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs Bowood entered the room.
She could contain herself no longer. What was
Mr Boyd about, that he did not at once introduce
his wife to herself and the Captain? Then she
was dying to apologise for her mistake of the
morning; besides which, her sense of hospitality
was outraged by the fact that Mrs Boyd had been
all this time in the house without having been
shown to her rooms or asked to partake of
refreshments of any kind. Such a state of affairs
must be put an end to forthwith.</p>

<p>Mrs Bowood came forward with her most genial
smile. ‘I am come to apologise for my absurd
mistake of this morning, though it was partly
your own fault, my dear Mrs Boyd.’ She had
hold of both Estelle’s hands by this time. ‘How
do you do? How do you do? Allow me to
welcome you to Rosemount.—Ah, Sir Frederick,
you here?’ This was said with some surprise.</p>

<p>‘I had the honour of making Mrs Boyd’s
acquaintance several years ago.’</p>

<p>‘Wonders will never cease.’ Then turning to
Estelle, she went on: ‘Only to think that I
mistook you for a French governess! But you
ought to have let me know at first who you were,
and then matters would have been set right at
once.’</p>

<p>‘I wanted to surprise my husband,’ answered
Estelle, with downcast eyes. ‘I wanted to see
whether he would know me again, after so long
a time.’</p>

<p>‘As if he could help knowing you and he
your husband! I can imagine how overjoyed
he must have been to see you again.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Cher</i> Oscar! He was distracted with joy.
He could scarcely speak to me at first for
emotion.’</p>

<p>Sir Frederick smiled cynically, but did not
speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">{75}</span></p>

<p>‘No chance for Laura now,’ said Mrs Bowood
to herself. ‘How fortunate this woman did not
come a day later.’</p>

<p>Mrs Bowood had left the room-door wide open,
and at this juncture her eye caught sight of Lady
Dimsdale, who was passing along the corridor
on her way to the side-door that opened into the
grounds. ‘Laura, Laura! come here,’ she called.
‘I want to introduce you to Mrs Boyd.’</p>

<p>‘The woman he kissed!’ muttered Estelle
between her teeth.</p>

<p>‘Checkmate for my Lady Disdain,’ remarked
Sir Frederick to himself with a shrug.</p>

<p>Lady Dimsdale hearing herself called by name
turned back, and entered the room. She looked
a little paler than ordinary, but was perfectly
composed. Going straight up to Estelle, she
held out her hand. ‘Mrs Boyd and I have met
already,’ she said in her most matter-of-fact
tone.</p>

<p>‘Ah, <i>oui</i>,’ answered Estelle with a shrug, as
she took the proffered hand for a moment and
then let it drop.</p>

<p>‘Met before!’ exclaimed Mrs Bowood in amazement.</p>

<p>‘A couple of hours ago,’ said Lady Dimsdale.</p>

<p>‘For one minute only,’ explained Estelle.</p>

<p>‘Then I must introduce you.—This is Lady
Dimsdale, one of my dearest friends.—Laura—Mrs
Boyd.’</p>

<p>‘I am enchanted to make the acquaintance of
Lady Dimsdale.’</p>

<p>‘’Tis a pity Lady D. cannot return the compliment,’
muttered Sir Frederick to himself.</p>

<p>Mrs Bowood turned to him. ‘By-the-bye, Sir
Frederick, have you seen the Captain since
luncheon?’ With that the two crossed over to
the window and began to talk together.</p>

<p>‘Mrs Boyd, I feel that some explanation is
due to you,’ said Lady Dimsdale in a low voice to
the other.</p>

<p>‘I have not asked for any explanation, Lady
Dimsdale.’</p>

<p>‘I repeat that one is due to you.’</p>

<p>‘As you please,’ answered the other, with a
little lifting of her shoulders; and with that she
sat down and yawned unmistakably behind her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>‘Mr Boyd and I were acquainted many years
ago, before he went abroad,’ began Lady Dimsdale.
‘He was a frequent visitor at my father’s vicarage.
After he went away, I never saw him again till
yesterday. This morning, fully believing that
you had been dead for many years, he asked me
to become his wife.’</p>

<p>‘You did not say No,’ sneered Estelle.</p>

<p>‘At that moment you entered the room.’</p>

<p>‘It was very bad taste on my part, I confess.
Had I known how you were engaged, I would
have waited five minutes longer.’</p>

<p>‘With all my heart, I wish that you had come
an hour sooner!’</p>

<p>‘I told you that I did not require any explanation.
Now that you have chosen to press one on
me, what is the value of it? <i>Absolument rien!</i>
The world is wide, and one kiss more or less is
of little consequence.’ She rose, and crossed to
the table and opened a book of photographs.</p>

<p>‘And that woman is Oscar Boyd’s wife!’ said
Lady Dimsdale to herself as she looked after her.
Her heart was very, very bitter.</p>

<p>Mrs Bowood turned as Estelle crossed to the
table. ‘I am afraid you will think us all very
inhospitable, Mrs Boyd,’ she said; ‘but it is
your husband’s fault that you did not come in
to luncheon. However, a tray will be ready for
you in a few minutes. By-the-bye, has any one
shown you your rooms?’</p>

<p>‘My rooms, madame! We—that is, my husband
and I—are going to London by the next
train. At least, that is what Oscar says.’</p>

<p>‘Going away by the next train! Mr Boyd had
promised to stay a week, and why need he go
away because you have arrived?’</p>

<p>‘I only know, madame, that he told me he was
going away.’</p>

<p>‘That will never do. I must talk to him; and
Captain Bowood must talk to him; and you,
Lady Dimsdale, and you, Sir Frederick, must add
your persuasions to ours to induce Mr Boyd not
to run away from us in this sudden fashion.
Next week we have two picnics and an archery
meeting—and Mrs Boyd has been so long away
from England!’</p>

<p>‘I am sure Mr Boyd can’t be hard-hearted
enough to resist all our entreaties,’ said the
Baronet. ‘The influence of Lady Dimsdale alone
might’——</p>

<p>‘You rate my influence too highly, Sir Frederick,’
interrupted Laura hastily, while a warm
flush mounted to her cheek. ‘In a matter like
this, Mr Boyd probably knows his own business
better than any one.’</p>

<p>The Baronet, in nowise disconcerted, turned
to Estelle: ‘To run away from us so soon would
be cruel indeed.’ Then to Mrs Bowood: ‘I am
sure we are all anxious for the pleasure of Mrs
Boyd’s further acquaintance. We want to know
her better—we want to hear the story of her
adventures, of her wonderful escape from shipwreck.’</p>

<p>‘A dangerous man this—I hate him!’ muttered
Estelle between her teeth.</p>

<p>‘Yes—of course—the story of the shipwreck,’
cried impulsive Mrs Bowood. ‘I had forgotten
that for the moment. We are all dying to hear
it.’</p>

<p>Estelle’s eyes were on Lady Dimsdale. ‘The
woman he kissed says nothing,’ was her unspoken
comment. Then turning to Mrs Bowood, she
said: ‘The shipwreck? O yes, I will tell you
all about the shipwreck—but not to-day. I am
a little tired.’</p>

<p>‘I am sure you must be, and hungry too. We
have all been very remiss,’ replied the mistress
of Rosemount. Then putting her arm into that
of Estelle, she added: ‘But your tray will be
ready by this time, and Mr Boyd must join you
when he comes down. Meanwhile, I want to
introduce you to Captain Bowood.—Laura, dear,
you are coming?’</p>

<p>‘I will join you in a few minutes,’ was Lady
Dimsdale’s reply. She wanted to be alone.</p>

<p>Mrs Bowood and Estelle quitted the room
together. Sir Frederick lingered behind for a
moment.</p>

<p>‘What a happy man our friend Boyd must be
to-day.—Don’t you think so, dear Lady Dimsdale?’
he said with a smirk.</p>

<p>‘Very happy, Sir Frederick,’ answered Laura,
looking him steadily in the eyes. ‘Who can
doubt it?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">{76}</span></p>

<p>‘Lucky dog! lucky dog!’ ejaculated the
Baronet as he followed the other ladies from
the room.</p>

<p>Lady Dimsdale sank into an easy-chair. ‘His
wife! His wife!’ How the words kept ringing
in her brain. ‘Thank heaven she came at the
moment she did, and not five minutes later!
And yet if she had come an hour sooner, that
would have been better still. Would it? I don’t
know. I cannot tell. His words were so sweet
to me! Did I answer him? No. He looked
into my eyes and read his answer there. And
now I must never see him or think of him more!
Oh, my darling—the love of my girlhood—the
only love of my life—it is hard to bear, hard
to bear!’ She felt as if her heart were surcharged
with tears; they glistened in her eyes.</p>

<p>At this moment Oscar Boyd entered the room.
He gave a little start when he saw who was in
it. He had not expected to find her there. From
the head of the staircase, just as he was on the
point of coming down, he had seen his wife and
Mrs Bowood enter the dining-room, and he guessed
what had happened during his absence. The
hard set look on his pale face softened inexpressibly
as his eyes rested on Lady Dimsdale.
‘Laura!’ he said, pausing for an instant with
the handle of the door in his hand.</p>

<p>She neither looked up nor answered him;
for a moment or two she was afraid to trust either
her eyes or her voice.</p>

<p>He shut the door, and went forward and took
one of her hands. ‘Laura!’ he said again, and
there was a world of tenderness in the way he
pronounced that one little word.</p>

<p>Then she looked up, and he saw the tears
shining in her eyes. ‘Oscar!—I may call you so
for the last time—we ought to have parted without
another word.’</p>

<p>‘I could not have gone away without seeing
you again, if only for a few minutes.’</p>

<p>‘You <i>are</i> going away?’</p>

<p>‘By the next train.’</p>

<p>‘It is better so.’</p>

<p>‘Laura! when I spoke to you this morning, it
was in the full belief that I was a free man—that
no tie existed on earth to debar me from
saying the words I said then.’</p>

<p>‘I know it—I know it.’</p>

<p>‘The woman—my wife—whom I had every
reason to believe had died long ago, will accompany
me when I leave this place. But to-morrow
she and I will part for ever. Her future will
be duly cared for, and after that I shall never
see her again. Laura! you and I may never meet
again after to-day. Think of me sometimes
when I am far away.’</p>

<p>‘Always—always.’</p>

<p>‘O heavens, when I think how happy we might
have been! And now!’ Strong man though
he was, it was all he could do to keep himself
from breaking down. He was possessed by an
almost irresistible impulse to fling his arms round
her and press her passionately to his heart.</p>

<p>Love’s fine instinct told Laura something of
what was passing in his breast. She stood up
and laid one hand softly on his arm. ‘You had
better go now,’ she said very gently. ‘No more
words are needed between you and me. We
know what we know, and no one can deprive
us of that knowledge.’</p>

<p>He felt the wisdom of her words. To delay
that which was inevitable was merely to prolong
her misery and his own. Besides, his wife might
enter the room at any moment. And yet—and
yet it was so hard to have his treasure torn from
him at the very moment he had made it his
own!</p>

<p>Laura had a rose in the bosom of her dress.
She took it out and fixed it in his button-hole.
‘Now go. Not another word,’ she whispered.</p>

<p>‘I shall write to you once before I sail,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘No—no; better not.’</p>

<p>He did not dispute the point, but took each
of her hands in one of his. For the space of
a few seconds they stood heart to heart, as it
were, gazing into each other’s eyes. Then Oscar
lifted first one hand and then the other, and pressed
them to his lips with a sort of reverent passionate
tenderness. ‘Farewell, my darling, farewell!’</p>

<p>The words struck a chill to her heart. They
were the last anguished cry of love and happiness
lost for ever.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GLIMPSES_OF_THE_SCOT_ABROAD">GLIMPSES OF THE SCOT ABROAD.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> years ago, I was what is called a ‘globe-trotter,’
by which title, as the reader knows, is
meant that distinctively modern personage—the
world-tourist. He is the creation of the steamboat
and the rail, and of all the Ariel-like capabilities
due to recent discoveries and improvements
in locomotion by land and sea. The term
globe-trotter is suggestive. One conjures up a
traveller, knapsack on back, poking his nose
into the Himalayas, sauntering across Sahara,
brushing past the Pyramids, leaving his card at
Calcutta, scampering over the American prairie,
lunching at Rome, and dropping in to see the
Seven Churches of Asia. The voyager of to-day
can buttonhole Old Father Time, and be on
familiar terms with his primal relative Space.
It was thus that in the course of two or three
years I was fortunate enough to visit most of the
embryo kingdoms which make up our colonial
empire, as well as Britain’s great dependency in
the East. As need scarcely be said, I boasted a
note-book, for what traveller of this era is without
one, wherewith on his return to publish Passages,
Reminiscences, Fly-leaves, or Jottings of his
unique wanderings? From the memoranda made
during this tour round the world, I have compiled
several incidents connected with the Scot abroad.
These pretend to be nothing more than ripples
on the current of colonial life, giving slight hints
as to moods and bearing of the Scot abroad, in
the varying scenes of his exile.</p>

<p>It is a truism to say that Scotsmen are to be
found in every corner of the habitable globe. As
I once heard a Melbourne Englishman remark:
‘If there were no Scotchmen, what would the
world do for bank-managers?’ They have been
noted as enterprising emigrants, and, in a large
number of cases, successful colonists. I met with
few instances of Scotchmen complaining in respect
of their material welfare. One man in Queensland
had a somewhat unique grievance, which,
however, he set forth with a twinkle in the eye:
‘There’s the government spendin’ pounds upon
pounds in bringin’ oot folk to this country, while
here’s me wi’ fifteen bairns, maistly a’ born here,
an’ I’ve never got a penny for ony o’ them!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">{77}</span></p>

<p>Otago is perhaps the most Scottish of any
portion of the colonial empire, though Ontario
runs it very close. Dunedin is almost undiluted
in its Scottish nationality, and is a city of considerable
stir. Sabbatarian questions, as well as
the question of instrumental music in the church,
are warmly discussed in Otago. At a certain
gathering of Presbyterian clergymen, one of them
urged that organs should be introduced in order
to draw more young people to the church; upon
which an old minister remarked that this was
acting on the principle of ‘O whistle, an’ I’ll come
to ye, my lad!’ The Scot abroad has a great love
for the institutions of his native country, and
endeavours to transplant as many of them as circumstances
will allow. Even the winter weather
of Scotland induces kindly recollections in the
breasts of old settlers. I remember, after a
phenomenal fall of snow in Dunedin, the like
of which had not been seen for twenty years, an
elder of the kirk exclaiming, as he rubbed his
hands: ‘Sic glorious snaw-ba’ fechts we had—it
mindit me o’ langsyne! Man, I was sorry when
the thaw cam’ on.’ Caledonian Societies flourish
all over New Zealand as much as does the thistle
itself. On the Thames gold-field, in the province
of Auckland, there was a corps of Highland
Volunteers. Whenever they marched through
the town, they were invariably followed by numbers
of Maories, who tied blankets round their
waists, like kilts, and no doubt imagined themselves
sufficiently Celtic.</p>

<p>The national dishes are much in vogue in New
Zealand. An English lady in Wellington, the
capital of that colony, on one occasion detailed
how she had tried to make a haggis in order to
please her husband, who hailed from north of
the Tweed. With the help of a cookery-book,
the numerous ingredients were collected and
prepared, and at last inserted in a big pot. Alas!
the haggis would not sink, despite renewed
efforts. The lady, in despair, called in an
experienced neighbour, who pierced the haggis
with a fork, and successfully ‘scuttled’ it. I am
sorry to add that after all the wife’s trouble and
anxiety, the dish proved a total failure. It is to
be hoped that her husband was not so difficult
to please as the well-to-do tradesman in Auckland,
who grumbled sorely as to New Zealand ‘not
being fit for a Scotsman to live in.’ ‘How’s
that?’ ‘Weel, the fact is I—I—canna get my
parritch made to please me!’ Talking of porridge,
the dish was a favourite in the Christchurch Hotel,
province of Canterbury, where it was cooked
by a Frenchman who now and again actually
spoke broken Scotch with a Parisian accent;
while at Wanganui, in the North Island, the
‘parritch’ was prepared by a Chinese cook.</p>

<p>To say that Scotsmen abroad are still fond of
their national music is simply to say that they
do not cease to be Scotsmen. If anything, the
fondness becomes intensified. I once heard an
enthusiast in South Africa observe: ‘<i>My Ain
Fireside</i>—<i>Ye Banks and Braes</i>—<i>The Land o’ the
Leal</i>—eh! a body could be fit to gang to heaven
hearing thae sangs sung!’ At a mission-school
connected with the Scotch Church in Cape Town
I once listened to <i>Weel may the Boatie row</i>, sung
as a duet by a Dutch girl and a Malay, a result
attained by the enthusiasm of the Scottish schoolmaster.
It seemed to me as incongruous as
hearing the Old Hundred in the ‘Scots Kirk’ of
Calcutta, unwittingly accompanied by the tom-toms
of a Hindu festival transpiring in the street.
Now that I have taken the reader so far as India,
let me note also that in the Church of Scotland
College at Calcutta I saw an advanced class of
Bengali youths reading Scott’s <i>Lady of the Lake</i>
and making marginal notes. Returning to
Australia, a pleasant memory is that of an afternoon
spent in a school at Sandhurst, the aforetime
‘Bendigo.’ Here, after the ordinary class-duties
had been performed, the scholars were initiated
into the mysteries of Highland reels and strathspeys,
under the tutorship of an Aberdonian
dame, the Aberdonian schoolmaster accompanying
on the fiddle. I recollect, too, how an Irish
grocer in Adelaide, South Australia, was moved
to stand outside his door in the bright moonlight
evenings and play <i>Monymusk</i> on a tin whistle.
A vision of Canada now rises before me, with its
host of local bards, each with his wallet of poems
on his back, trudging from village to village—the
troubadours of the backwoods. Their warblings
were not of the snow-laden forest, the subdued
glory of the Indian summer, the autumn-gilded
maple, or the swift, miraculous dawn of the
Columbian spring. Their strains were those of
exile; strains of Scotia, of ‘hame,’ of rippling
burnies, of the purple heather, of the thousand-and-one
historic and sympathetic memories of
the dear old land. But hark! what sounds do we
hear echoing from a Sabbath school in Sacramento,
California? Scottish tunes, but linked to religious
words, the children singing a hymn of the church
militant to the melody of <i>Scots wha hae</i>; while <i>Ye
Banks and Braes</i> served as the tender medium
for stanzas of a more devotional character.</p>

<p>The farmer is a notable figure in one’s Canadian
remembrances, the agricultural class comprising
about half the population. In Ontario you will
find many old Scotch settlers, and much could
be written upon their present and past experiences.
The times are considerably altered from
the days when the rough pioneering work had
to be done. I once met two aged farmers, one
of whom had seen eighty-three winters, who had
emigrated to Canada together about forty years
ago, and might have been taken for typical old
settlers. In telling their primitive toils and
privations, their weather-beaten faces were lit
up with an animation that was almost joyous in
its character. One related, as if it were some
rare humour, that his first log-hut in the backwoods
was at many places open to the heavens,
and that frequently he had to dust the snow off
his blankets before he went to bed. The wintry
theme suggests the story of a Scottish Canadian
who, on a voyage to the mother-country, was one
day found sleeping on deck, when the captain
roused him with a natural caution against sunstroke.
‘Sunstroke!’ scornfully replied the
awakened one. ‘It wad tak’ a’ the sun atween
here an’ Greenock to thaw the Canada frost oot
o’ my head.’</p>

<p>In Salt Lake City there are not a few Scottish
Mormons. I chanced to have a brief conversation
there with a middle-aged Scotchwoman, who was
a follower of Brigham Young, and who did not
hesitate to magnify the virtues of polygamy. It
turned out, however, that her zeal was largely of
a theoretical nature, as the good lady did not seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">{78}</span>
to believe in the system so far as it might entail
any discomfort upon herself. At Omaha I was
acquainted with a Highlander who in the first
days of Mormonism became converted to polygamy,
but who ultimately abjured the faith.
Many a time and oft, in Celtic daring, had he
stood on the banks of the Missouri River, lifting
up his voice in the wilderness like the Baptist
of old, denouncing Mormonism to the bands of
converts as they passed over the stream to the
ostensible Land of Canaan. His life was in daily
peril, but he escaped scathless from his self-imposed
mission. In San Francisco I saw Elder
Stenhouse, who had been until lately a chief
among the Utah Saints. He and his wife, both
Scotch people, had dedicated themselves honestly
to the new faith, but finding out its hollowness,
they shook off the dust of the desert—there is
plenty of it—from their shoes, and took farewell
of Salt Lake.</p>

<p>In travelling about from place to place you
make acquaintance with a most interesting type
of character—that of the veteran Scotchman. In
Christchurch, New Zealand, I met a Waterloo
veteran, eighty-four years of age, yet with erect,
military carriage. With vivacious garrulity he
told that he was born in Fife; that he had
lodged at the house of Mrs Grant of Laggan; that
he knew ‘Jamie Hogg’ and Nathaniel Gow; that
he had been all through the Peninsular War, had
fought at Waterloo, and had been on half-pay
since 1817. A companion-figure was that of the
venerable Highlander of King William’s Town,
Cape Colony—a genial-hearted man, of stern brow
and with war-worn features—whose talk was a
strange blending of pleasant Scottish reminiscence
and weird stories of Kaffir campaigns in which
he had taken part. Again, while sailing up the
Suez Canal, on the voyage home from India, one
of my fellow-passengers was an old Scotsman who
had fought at Waterloo, and was then engaged
making a tour of the world. As he said, with
pleasant pathos: ‘I want to see all that’s to be
seen before I’m happit up in the mools’—a
phrase that can only be inadequately rendered
in English as ‘lying snug beneath the sod.’ He
left the steamer at Port Saïd, as he was bound
on an excursion to the Holy Land, and as the
quarter-master offered to carry his portmanteau,
the old fellow elbowed him aside, exclaiming:
‘Pooh, pooh; I’m a young man yet!’ Last and
not least notable of this class was an old and
well-preserved gentleman I met at Wellington,
New Zealand. He was an Edinburgh man, and
had been educated at the university there. He
had been acquainted with friends of Burns, had
known the poet’s ‘Chloris’ and ‘Clarinda,’ and
in speaking of the Potterrow always seemed to
regard it as still a fashionable street. To gossip
with him was like shaking hands with the
past.</p>

<p>In going round the world, one is sure to find
relatives and souvenirs of famous men and women.
At Hobart-Town, Tasmania, there resided, when
I visited the town, the granddaughter of Neil
Gow and daughter of Nathaniel Gow, the composer
of <i>Caller Herrin’</i>. In the Waikato district
of the North Island of New Zealand,
about a hundred miles from the city of Auckland,
lives, I still trust, old Mrs Nicol, mother of
the late Robert Nicol, the celebrated Perthshire
poet. During a stormy passage in a small steamer
on the New Zealand coast, I had some interesting
chats with an Irish gentleman who had met and
talked with Sir Walter Scott in a chapel in Italy,
during the closing scenes of that busy life. I
may add also that at Listowel, in Ontario, I was
privileged to meet the brother of Dr Livingstone,
and was much struck with the facial resemblance
between him and the great traveller. In the
University of Dunedin the visitor can see, in a
gilt frame, a lock of Burns’s hair, labelled ‘A
genuine relic of the Poet, and modicum of a larger
lock owned by Jean Armour.’ A certain country
hotel in Tasmania lives in my memory from its
having distributed through its rooms an extraordinary
number of pictures of John Knox, the
religious character of the house being increased
by the fact that one of the apartments was used
as the ‘study’ of the Presbyterian clergyman of
the village. The name of John Knox, by association,
recalls to my mind the incident of the
eccentric Scot of Kaffraria, South Africa, who
had a portrait of Mary Queen of Scots hung in
his bedroom, and who, every morning on rising,
stretched his hands towards it, crying: ‘O my
poor murdered queen!’</p>

<p>The visitor fresh from home is certain of
meeting with a kind welcome from his countrymen
abroad. The welcome need not be on
personal grounds. An Edinburgh man in Canada
once shook my hand warmly, saying: ‘I dinna
ken ye; I never met ye before; but I just want
to see a man that’s seen Arthur Seat since I saw
it.’ The love of home sometimes reaches an
intense pitch, as in the case of the Scotsman at
Fort Beaufort, in Cape Colony, who ejaculated:
‘I’d rather gang hame and be hanged, than dee
here a natural death!’ Again, an old man in
New Zealand remarked: ‘I doot I’ll no get
hame to Scotland again; but if onybody said:
“Ye shall not go,” I’d be off the morn’s mornin’!’
With which forcible yet touching deliverance let
these glimpses conclude.</p>

<p>I am afraid that during our brief bird’s-eye view
of colonial life, the reader has been dragged hither
and thither in a somewhat erratic course. The
irregularity, however, has been more apparent
than real. Whether amid Canadian snows, New
Zealand mountains, Australian bush, or South
African <i>veldt</i>, you meet with the same shrewd,
persevering Scotsman, steadily moving in his
colonial orbit, and moving none the less regularly
because of the tender gravitation of his heart
towards the central sphere of patriotic affection—dear
though distant Scotland.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IS_SMOKING_INJURIOUS_TO_HEALTH">IS SMOKING INJURIOUS TO HEALTH?</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the above important question is so
frequently asked, more especially of medical men,
yet their replies are as a general rule either
of a vague or dogmatic nature that is anything
but satisfactory. There has been unlimited discussion
respecting the injurious effects of smoking,
ever since the first introduction of tobacco, and
a great deal of nonsense has unfortunately been
urged by enthusiasts on both sides. Some have
praised tobacco far beyond its merits; while
others have so enlarged upon its injurious and
poisonous qualities as to make one wonder that
anybody who smokes should be left alive at all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">{79}</span>
Hitherto, however, no satisfactory solution of the
problem appears to have been arrived at. Our
object in this paper will be to deal as concisely as
possible with the subject upon its merits.</p>

<p>In the first place, we may inform our readers
that smoking is and is not injurious. This apparently
contradictory assertion admits, however, of
the following explanation. In New England, it
has been with truth alleged that the thirst induced
by smoking is an active incentive to alcoholic
excess and its attendant evils. Now, on the
other hand, amongst Asiatic nations the reverse
holds good. Mr Lane—translator of the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>—when in the East, noticed that smoking
appeared to possess a soothing effect, attended with
slight exhilaration, and that it supplied the place
of alcoholic beverages. Mr Layard, whose knowledge
of eastern nations is most extensive, was
also of the same opinion. Mr Crawford, again,
an authority of high repute as regards Asiatic
habits, believes the use of tobacco has contributed
to the sobriety both of Asiatic and European
nations. Here we have two entirely contradictory
results, as, in North America smoking produces
dissipation; whilst in the East it not only
restrains, but takes its place. It is therefore
to climate, temperament, and bodily constitution
acting and reacting upon each other, that we may
trace so opposite an effect.</p>

<p>The chemical constituents of tobacco are three,
the due consideration of which is highly important.
They are: (1) A volatile oil; (2) a volatile
alkali; (3) an empyreumatic oil. The volatile oil,
although in minute quantities, has a most powerful
action on the physical system, even in the
smallest dose; and when taken internally, gives
rise to nausea with giddiness. The volatile alkali
is <i>nicotine</i>, possessing narcotic and very poisonous
qualities; so much so indeed, that a single drop
of it is sufficient to kill a dog. The proportion
of this substance in the dry tobacco-leaf varies
from two to eight per cent., according to Professor
Johnston, who states that ‘in smoking a quarter
of an ounce of tobacco, two grains or more of
one of the most subtle poisons known may be
drawn into the smoker’s mouth;’ the reason why
he is not poisoned being because this deadly juice
is not concentrated. Empyreumatic oil (from Gr.
<i>empyreuo</i>, I kindle), the third active ingredient of
tobacco, is so called to express the burned smell
and acrid taste which result from the combustion
of the tobacco during smoking. This oil closely
resembles in its action that which is produced
from poisonous foxglove leaf (<i>Digitalis purpurea</i>).
A drop of empyreumatic oil when applied to the
tongue of a cat has produced convulsions and death
in a few minutes. Reptiles are destroyed by it
as through an electric shock. It must be borne
in mind that these three chemical ingredients are
<i>united</i> when smoking, and produce to a greater or
less degree their respective effects. A cigar when
smoked to the <i>end</i> effectually discharges into
the smoker’s mouth everything produced by its
combustion. When saliva is retained in the
mouth, the effects of tobacco in one sense become
more markedly developed on the nervous system.
On the other hand, when constant expectoration
takes place, digestion becomes impaired, from the
diminution of saliva, which plays an important
part in this function. We have heard medical
men, who were themselves smokers, aver that
the former is the least of the two evils; which
we hope is the case, as the habit of constant
expectoration in which many smokers indulge,
is certainly one of the most unpleasant concomitants
of the pipe or cigar.</p>

<p>In a purely physiological sense, smoking acts
as follows: (1) The heart’s action becomes lowered;
(2) the elimination of carbonic acid is diminished,
thus interfering with the respiratory power;
(3) the waste of the body is checked, and digestion
to a certain extent impeded. Excessive smoking
disorders digestion, and, where the heart is weak,
often induces disease of that organ. It is by
no means uncommon to find habitual smokers
troubled with dyspepsia. Dr Leared considers
excessive smoking decidedly productive of indigestion.
Dr Pereira, who was a high authority on
such matters, when alluding to habitual smokers
in his celebrated <i>Materia Medica</i>, observes: ‘The
practice, when moderately indulged in, provokes
thirst, increases the secretion of saliva, and produces
that remarkably soothing and tranquillising
effect upon the mind which has caused it to be
so much admired and adopted by all classes of
society, and by all nations civilised and barbarous.’
Later on, the same eminent authority states that
‘when indulged in to excess, and especially by
those unaccustomed to its use, smoking causes
nausea, trembling, and in some cases paralysis
and death.’ Instances are recorded of persons killing
themselves by smoking seventeen or eighteen
pipes at a sitting!</p>

<p>In his luminous <i>Treatise on Poisons</i>, Dr Christison
states that ‘no well-ascertained ill effects
have been shown to result from the habitual practice
of smoking.’ On the other hand, Dr Prout, a
late distinguished physician and chemist, was of
a different opinion. He observes: ‘Tobacco disorders
the assimilating functions in general, but
particularly, I believe, the assimilation of saccharine
principle. It is the weak and those
predisposed to disease who fall victims to its
poisonous operation, whilst the strong and healthy
suffer comparatively little therefrom.’ So even
this learned physician’s opinion is to a certain
extent thus modified.</p>

<p>The researches of Dr Richardson, F.R.S., are
of immense value with regard to the action of
tobacco upon the health. He is of opinion that
there are no grounds for believing that smoking—of
course, we infer, when indulged in with moderation—can
produce organic change. Functional
disturbances of the heart, brain, and vision, he
tells us, may be traced to its excessive use. It is
universally, however, admitted that tobacco, like
alcohol—in minute doses—arrests oxidation of
living tissues, thus checking their disintegration.
Dr Richardson, for this reason, justly considers
smoking highly injurious to the young, causing
impairment of growth.</p>

<p>In the course of an important discussion which
took place between Sir Ranald Martin, Mr Solly,
Dr Ranking, and other scientific physicians,
the following important results were arrived at
respecting smoking: (1) That the habit is only
prejudicial when carried to excess; (2) that
tobacco is innocuous as compared with alcohol,
and in no case worse than tea, and by the
side of high living, contrasts most favourably.
Whether smoking is or is not injurious
to health depends principally upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">{80}</span>
following conditions: (1) The kind of tobacco
smoked; (2) the manner in which it is consumed;
(3) the amount of tobacco smoked; and lastly,
when it is indulged in. The great object is to
obtain a tobacco which possesses the smallest percentage
of nicotine. It was formerly believed
that the best varieties of Havana and Turkish
tobacco were the most innocuous. According, however,
to the recent exhaustive researches of Dr
George Harley, F.R.S., it appears that the more
delicate the aroma of tobacco, the more poisonous
it becomes. Dr Harley is also of opinion that
‘Caporal’ tobacco contains <i>least nicotine</i>, and is
consequently to be preferred by those desirous of
health. Pipes made of clay, and meerschaums—not
foul—are, Dr Richardson considers, in a
hygienic point of view, superior to cigars and
cigarettes. Neither cigars nor cigarettes should
ever be smoked near the end, as the nicotine
then is discharged into the mouth in larger
proportions. M. Melsens, a very distinguished
chemist, is of opinion that a plug of cotton-wool
saturated with a solution of strong citric or tannic
acid should be inserted in the stem of the pipe,
cigar, or cigarette holder. By this precaution,
the smoke is effectually filtered, ere reaching the
mouth, as the nicotine would then be seized by
and combined with the acid. Those who object
to this plan on account of its trouble, might with
advantage place a small piece of plain cotton-wool
in the stem of their pipe as a filtering agent.
This should on each occasion be removed and
replaced by a fresh one. A more convenient, and
probably not less effective plug, is a bit of paper
crumpled into a soft ball and placed in the bottom
of the pipe. It acts as an absorbent of the objectionable
juices which might otherwise find their
way into the mouth, and can be changed, if the
smoker chooses, every time he fills his pipe.</p>

<p>From a review of the scientific testimony and
physiological facts bearing upon this subject, we
may safely arrive at the following conclusions:
(1) That smoking in excess is decidedly an
injurious habit, frequently causing dyspepsia,
and functional diseases of the heart, brain, and
nervous system. (2) That smoking, even when
in moderation, is pernicious in early life, also to
certain constitutions, and in particular conditions
of the body. (3) That in adult life and in ordinary
health, no well-ascertained ill effects have
been demonstrated as owing their causation to
<i>moderate</i> smoking. (4) That the <i>moderate</i> use
of tobacco is not only in many cases a harmless
luxury, but occasionally, from its soothing and
tranquillising influence, a useful adjunct. Smoking,
even in the strictest moderation, with some
persons of peculiar idiosyncrasies, acts as a poison,
and should therefore be avoided, when feelings
of discomfort are entailed by its use.</p>

<p>It is impossible to lay down any rule as to the
amount of tobacco which may be consumed without
a deleterious effect upon the health. What
would be moderation to one is often excess to
another, according to temperament, habit, and
individual peculiarities. Each person ought to
be able to judge for himself as to what is moderation.
The best time for smoking is undoubtedly
after a meal; and the most injurious, on an empty
stomach.</p>

<p>In drawing this paper to a close, we cannot do
better than by appending the following extract,
taken from Mr Dawson’s valuable little work on
longevity. On page sixty-nine of <i>How to Prolong
Life</i>, when speaking of smoking, Mr Dawson
observes: ‘All things taken into account, it is
evident that tobacco in excess is certainly prejudicial
to good health; in moderation, however,
it may be indulged in with comparative impunity;
but under any circumstances, it should be known
that a man in health is much better without it.
How much more so in the case of those who are
weakly! Lastly, I desire to impress upon all
smokers that <i>moderation</i> in this habit is of no
small moment, the ill effects being proportioned
to indulgence.’</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
